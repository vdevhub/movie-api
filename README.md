# Movie API

This API represents a server-side component of a movie web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

The API is built with:
- MongoDB
- Express
- Node.js

Movie API is hosted on [Heroku](https://movies-myflix-api-84dbf8740f2d.herokuapp.com/documentation.html). It also has documentation built with [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).
